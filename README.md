# Receipt Calculator

This project is Task 2 of my internship with Octanet Services, where I am developing a Receipt Calculator using Python.
Overview

The Receipt Calculator simplifies the process of managing purchases by providing functionalities to calculate the total cost, tax, discounts, and more. It also supports saving the receipt for future reference.
# Core Functionalities

    Input Management:
        Accepts input for items (name, price, and quantity).

            Total cost
            Tax and discount details
        Option to save the receipt as a text file or PDF (bonus feature).

# Technical Specifications

    Programming Language: Python
    Design Approach: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    Data Management: Utilizes collections (like List) to manage product data.
    File Handling:
        Save receipt data for later retrieval.
        Generate output files for the receipt.

# Features in Progress
